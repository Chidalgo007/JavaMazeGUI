For a recent university assignment, I developed a maze and implemented an algorithm to find the shortest path from the entrance to the exit. </br>
This project involved using nodes and the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to efficiently navigate through the maze. </br>

In another project, I worked on an image processing task where I had to upload a picture with noise and remove the noise. </br>
I achieved this by implementing an algorithm that fills the noisy areas with the median color of the surrounding pixels, effectively restoring the image quality.
